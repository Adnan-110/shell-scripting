# What is Variable?
# A variable is something that holds data dynamically

# The advantage & disadvantage in shell is that there are no Data types.
# In bash everything will be considered as string by default.

a = 10
b = Ten

# How can we print a variable in scripting ?
# To print a variable u need to start with a $ sign.
# Example below 

echo printing the value of a : $a
echo printing the value of b : ${b}
